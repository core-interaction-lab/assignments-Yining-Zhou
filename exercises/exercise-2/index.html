                    <h3>Our DNA is a crucial part of creating every cell in our bodies. It is the instruction manual our cells read to know exactly what to do and how to act. But how do our bodies proofread these instructions and know how to fix them if something goes wrong? Biochemists at the University of Utah are seeking to answer this question, and have made interesting new discoveries into the chemistry that leads to effective DNA repair.</h3>

                    <h3>We have 4 bases to all our DNA. They are molecules named adenine (A), guanine (G),cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Guanine is the most susceptible to a type of damage called oxidative stress, caused by rogue oxygen compounds called reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are a normal part of every cellâ€™s environment. However, at high levels, certain ROS can wreak havoc on normal cell function.</h3>
